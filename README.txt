**IMAGES**
I noticed that the images provided were huge and I therefor compressed the images both in quality and 50% in size in order to keep the loading speed to a minimum. So far I haven't noticed any difference because the images are displayed quite small on the page.

I also removed an unused image from assets/img. The img-folder went from 32,4 MB to 3,21 MB.

**FONTS**
Added a .WOFF font since some users on the forum had problems with the font and I wanted to make sure that mine works.
